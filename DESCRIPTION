Description: This package provides the function mapprox(), 
    an extension of the basic approx() function. 
    It is designed to handle cases where 
    two or more explanatory variables are used in the interpolated function. 
    However, the values of the explanatory variables in the source data 
    must be on a grid; that is, the data provided as x must cover 
    all combinations of the values of the explanatory variables.
